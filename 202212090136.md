# The Dress

> [!abstract]- Tags
> #meme #fashion #viral 

The dress[^1] was a meme in 2015 that broke friendships apart and caused a full out war on the internet. 

No one could decide whether the dress was blue or gold. Unlike the Harlem Shake, [[202212090137]] , which brought people together, the dress caused a impassable rift in an already divided nation.
