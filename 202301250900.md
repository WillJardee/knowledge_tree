# Experimental Design

```!!
How do we make a “hypothesis” in experimental papers?
```

## Hypothesis

good hypothesis:

* Defines the scope (a lot bigger than you want it to be) [[#Scope]]
* Defines research objective [[#Research Objective]]
* Means for evaluation [[#Means for Evaluation]]
* Quantifiable [[#Quantifiable]]
* Facilitates understanding by researcher and audience [[#Understanding]]
* Facilitates determining significance (not the statistical def) [[#Significance]]

Audience dependent - make sure you know your audience.

****
## Examples

* “algorithm A will perform better than algorithm B” - needs metric
* “Algorithm A, when augmented with local search, will yield significance increase in both precision and recall than without augmentation” - Great example
* “Classification of cloud types based on evolutionary spectral feature selection in deep learning” - Great example
* “… reliable extraction of redaction hermeneutics in the Textus Receptus” - too specific and domain reliant (audience dependent criteria)
* “… accurate identification of editorial preferences in ancient Greek texts such as the Textus Receptus”
* “… accurate classification of fruit fly geometry” - doesn’t explain significance
* “… improved accuracy in gene alignment based on frequented regions in DeBraign

****

## Experiments

* always run multiple runs (especially since we are in a stochastic space)
* hyperparameters
* run simulations

Very similar to how we run reinforcement learning, kinda
