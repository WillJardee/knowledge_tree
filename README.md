# Introduction

Welcome to **Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023**! Thanks for checking it out.

What you'll see in this repo is a **highly opinionated and unapologetic** way to use Obsidian. 

Some of these techniques may be familiar to you, others may be novel due to the *idiosyncracies* about how my own mind works. I'll do my best to explain all of my philosophies and lived experience in the creation of this vault. You'll see things that may suprise you, and other concepts you may be deeply familiar with. Some techniques are built in to the platform. Other techniques leverage powerful external softwares to greatly enhance the Obsidian experience. I'll argue for those as they come as well as provide potential alternatives.

By following this guide and leveraging this template, I can promise that you'll be able to evolve from possibly never having used Obsidian to **being up to date with the way I think about using this phenomenal software**. I hope you enjoy and have fun!!

# Motivation

I've been using Obsidian for well over a year and have developed many experiments, some of which succeeded and many others that have failed. I have tried to compile all the lessons from these experiences and create a vault that mirrors my up to date thinking on how Obsidian can be maximally utilized.


# Philosophies

Before we get into anything practical we **need** to discuss the underlying philosophies powering this vault, or none of the implementations will make any sense. Most of these philosophies I've learned or adapted from great contemporary and erstwhile thinkers and authors, and the following is a reflection of both my value structure as well as my take on the works of others.
