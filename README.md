# Introduction

Welcome to **Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023**! Thanks for checking it out.

What you'll see in this repo is a **highly opinionated and unapologetic** way to use Obsidian. Note that  this is not the *only* way to use Obsidian, nor is it the *correct* way. But it is a way that works really well, especially once you understand the [philosophies](#Philosophies) behind it.

Some of these techniques may be familiar to you, others may be novel due to the *idiosyncracies about how my own mind works*. I'll do my best to explain all of my philosophies and lived experience in the creation of this vault. Some techniques, processes and plugins are built into the platform. Other techniques leverage powerful external softwares to greatly enhance the Obsidian experience. I'll argue for those as they come as well as provide potential alternatives.

By following this guide and leveraging this template, I can promise that you'll be able to evolve from possibly never having used Obsidian to **being up to date with the way I think about using this phenomenal software**. I hope you enjoy and have fun!!

# Motivation

I've been using Obsidian for well over a year and have developed many experiments, some of which succeeded and many others that have failed. I have tried to compile all the lessons from these experiences and create a vault that mirrors my up to date thinking on how Obsidian can be maximally utilized.


# Philosophies

Before we get into anything practical we **need** to discuss the underlying philosophies powering this vault, or none of the implementations will make any sense. Most of these philosophies I've learned or adapted from great contemporary and erstwhile authors and thinkers -- the following is a reflection of both my value structure as well as my take on the works of others.

Philosophies we'll encounter along the way:
- Deep Work (Cal Newport)
- Time Block Planning (Cal Newport)
- PARA (Tiago Forte)
- CODE (Tiago Forte)
- Progressive Summarization (Tiago Forte)
- Zettelkasten (Luhmann)
- Published Zettelkasten (Andy Matuschack)
- An unexamined life is not worth living (Socrates)
- Jamming (Music Production)
- AGILE (Software Development Project Management)
- Metcalfe's Law (Computer Science)
- Atticus Finch is the same in the house as he is on the public streets (To Kill a Mockingbird)
- Large Language Models and Transformers (Machine Learning)
- Automation and Scripting (Software Development)
- Content management systems (Software Development)
- Antifragility (Nassim Taleb)
- GTD (David Allen)
- Version Control Systems (Software Development)
- Causa Sui (Ernst Becker)


## Deep Work

To do deep work is to be able to focus on a significant problem for an uninterrupted block of time. As a software engineer and writer, I am dependant on the flow state to create my best work and cut through the noise of digital and physical distraction.

To enhance the likliehood of entering the flow state, and enhancing the quality of the flow state while it's engaged, this vault has tools to help you cut through the mud and focus on what needs to get done.

Processes:
- Zettelkasten Harvesting
- Keeping relevant project info in one spot
- Vault wide task management protocols

Plugins:
- QuickAdd
- Tasks

## PARA

The PARA framework is a structure that can be used as buckets to capture different ideas. The main value to this vault is the `Project` and `Archive` folders. These two folders alone do a ton of work and allow resources to stay in sync with th

## Elements of Markdown

### Footers

Footers serve two very important roles: citation and non destructive updates. Citation is used in the [Zettelkasten](#Zettelkasten), to help link a note to its source material.

Footers also make for great **non destructive updates** to notes. This means you can revisit an old note, and instead of altering it directly, you can append a footnote to the end of a thought, without changing the structural meaning of the original file. Think of it as sedimentary rock, or a really lightweight [VCS](#version-control-system). 

Footnote Shortcut combined with Natural Landguage Dates allows for super easy non destructive updates that serve as asides, knowledge from a wiser and smarter future you.[^1]

# External Tools

**Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023** uses *a lot* of external tools and technologies. I firmly believe that each of these technologies plays a significant role in making Obsidian an ecosystem instead of a stand alone application. These tools serve as scouts, fetching information from different places and returning the goods to "home base". That being said, some/most/all have some form of financial component as well as their own learning curves, so I wouldn't be dissapointed if you don't want to use them. That said **Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023** works a lot better as a holistic system if you do.

### Tools Used

- Readwise ($)
- Alfred (Mac only) ($)
- Shortcuts (iOS only)
- Zotero
- GitHub
- Sync ($)
- Publish ($)


# Installation

Great! Now that that's out of the way, we can finally get to running the vault, *phew*! 

1. Select `Use this Template` **or** `git clone https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023.git`
2. Download into your local machine
3. Open the vault and rename it to whatever you want and open it in Obsidian


## After You're Up and Running

After getting your sea legs for a few days (perhaps a week!) and you feel comfortable with **Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023** system, it will sadly be time for us to part and for you to forge onwards. You'll be able to safely delete the following files:

- README
- \_tests/\*
- Readwise/ (if you're not using the service)
- \_tutorial/\*
- \_PARA/Archive/Archived Project (*!Note: do not delete the Archive folder itself, just the example folder*)
- \_PARA/Projects/Test Project (*!Note: do not delete the Projects folder itself, just the example folder*)
- \_PARA/Projects/Test Project 2 (*!Note: do not delete the Projects folder itself, just the example folder*)

## "Required" Plugins

Truly nothing in this vault is *required*, but if you want the full experience, these community plugins are quote-unquote mandatory:

- Auto Link Title
- Calendar
- Commander
- Dataview
- Excalidraw
- Folder Note
- Footnote Shortcut
- Kanban
- Natural Language Dates
- Obsidian Git
- Omnisearch
- Periodic Notes
- QuickAdd
- Random Note
- Readwise (*look -- I really hate to put a paid subscription plugin on the "required" list, but this app is **so** good, it's really revolutionized my reading experience across Twitter/Kindle/blogs/podcasts. Plus their new [Reader](https://readwise.io/read) app is straight up awesome. A lot of the ease of this vault derives from Readwise, so don't use it at your own risk*)
- Style Settings
- Supercharged Links

## Optional Plugins

These plugins aren't needed, as some are QoL and others have a steep price tag attached (some even have both!). But these apps are no less critical to my workflow than the "Required" apps above, so I need to include them.


# A Day in the Life - Real World Use

**Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023** is only helpful if you can use it day in/day out as a tool to help you in life. Here's how I would use it in any random day (let's say Tuesday, perhaps):

Noon (wake up -- *I'm a night owl and a degenerate*) ðŸ¤·


## Special Case: Saturday or Sunday

Reflection is a critical component to the value of this vault, and so one day a week **must** be carved out to do reflection. This shouldn't take more than thirty minutes or so, but it does need to happen once a week, so choose what works best for you.
