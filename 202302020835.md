# Dynamic Programming


## Examples

### ”Making Change”
Given: set of integers, $C$ (e.g. $\{1, 10, 25\}$) and some value $V$. 
Question: How can we recreate $V$ with the fewest number of elements of $C$ (with repeats); defined as $m(V)$.
$$m(V) = \min_{c\,\in \,C}m(V-c)+1 \, , \text{ s.t. } (V-c) \geq 0$$
$$\begin{align}
m(0) & = 0\\
m(1) & = m(1-1) + 1 = m(0) + 1 = 1\\
m(2) & = m(2-1) + 1 = 2\\
& \vdots\\
m(9) & = 9\\
m(10) & = \min\left\{m(10-1), \, m(10-10)\right\} +1 = m(0) + 1 = 1\\
& \vdots\\
m(30) & = \min\left\{m(30-25), \,m(30-10), \,m(30-29)\right\} +1 = \min\left\{5, 2, 5\right\} +1 = 3
\end{align}$$

### “Weighted Interval Scheduling”
Given: set of jobs, $J$, s.t. $J: x_i \mapsto (a_i, f_i, \$_i)$, where $x_i$ is called a job, $a_i$ is the arrival time, $f_i$ the finish time, and $\$$ is the value.
Goal: find a set $\bar{J} \subseteq J$, s.t. the $\sum_{x_i \in \bar{J}}(\$_i)$, such that no two jobs overlap

1. sort jobs by non-decreasing finish time: $f_1 \leq f_2 \leq \cdots \leq f_n$
2. $p(j) :=$ rightmost non-overlapping job that is to the left of job $j$; $p(j): j \mapsto \text{argmax}_{k}\left(f_k \leq a_j\right)$ 
3. Let $\text{OPT}(j):=$ the optimal value that can be obtained using jobs $\{1, \cdots, j\}$
	Recurrence:
		$\text{OPT}(0) = 0$
		$\text{OPT}(j) = \max \Big(\text{OPT}(j-1) \, , \, \text{OPT}(p(j)) + \$_j\Big)$
4. Solve the recurrence in 3. all the way down to $j=1$, and solve up to $\text{OPT}(n)$
5. $\bar{J} \leftarrow$ set defined by $\text{OPT}(n)$
