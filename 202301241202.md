Convex Hull algorithms:
Input: Set of points, $P \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $|P| < \infty$ 
Output: an ordered list of vertices on the convex hull in counter-clockwise order

### Graham Scan 
$\Theta(n \cdot \lg n)$ - comes from initial sorting
```ad-note
$\Theta (n \cdot \lg n)$ is the worst-case runtime of comparison based sort using real-RAM MOC

## Lecture 01-31-2023
Reduction: Sorting -> Convex Hull
	Project input to sort, $x$, to $x^2$ (any monotonically increasing function), then solve for Hull.
	To convert: $O(n)$
	Gives us a worse case analysis of $O(n \cdot \lg n)$ to Convex Hull.

### Jarvis March/Giftwrapping:
- Using the turning angle.
- Output sensitive gives $\Theta(n \cdot h)$
	- $h :=$ number of points on the hull
- start at random point, next point on hull will be the one with the smallest (positive) turning angle

### Chen’s Algorithm
- $\Theta(n \cdot \lg h)$
- given polygon $P$, point $q$ outside $P$; find $p_1$ and $p_2$ $\in P$ s.t. $P$ is “inside” the cone defined by rays $\overrightarrow{qp_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{q p_2}$ ; takes $\Theta(\lg n)$
- outline:
	1. Divide: compute mini-hull using Graham; 
		- $h \leftarrow \lceil n/h \rceil$ 
		- partition $P$ into $k$ equal sets, $P_1, P_2, \cdots, P_k$. Note: $|P| = h \pm 1 \in \Theta(h)$
		- Use Graham Scan to find CH of each $P$: result labeled $H_1, H_2, \cdots, H_k$
	2. Conquer: merge - we think of each “mini-hull” as a “fat-point” and use Jarvis on the mini-hulls.  
	This required a guess of $h$
	- if $h$ is too large, then step 1 is too long, solution: we sure $h$ doesn’t get too big: $h<h^* < h^2$, where $h^*$ is the optimal
	- if $h$ is too small, solution: once add too many points on hull, restart.

## Lecture 02-02-2023
Q: Given 2 line segments, do they intersect? (assume general form)
	$s_1 = (p_1, q_1)$ and $s_2 = (p_2, q_2)$ 
	$p_1$ and $q_1$ on different sides of $s_2$ $\land$ $p_2$ and $q_2$ on different sides of $s_1$ $\longrightarrow$ $s_1$ and $s_2$ intersect. 
	Easily provable via IVT (Intermediate Value Theorem) - look for both line segments holding the IVT

!! Can we get a more stable calculation of intersection by using the intersection as defined by orients than by algebra? !!
!! Why do you always jump to $\Theta$ instead of $O$? !!

### Line Intersection Problem
Given $S = \{s_i = (p_i, q_i)\}_{i=1}^n$
Find all intersection points, $|M| = m$

#### Naive algorithm:
see if every pair of lines intersect; $\Theta(n^2)$
- asserts $O(n^2)$ for this problem: $\therefore \exists \; \text{algorithm} \in \Theta(n^2) \rightarrow \text{problem} \in O(n^2)$  
```ad-note
Both $f(x) \in O(g(x))$ and $f(x) = O(g(x))$ are acceptable.
```

#### Sweep Line Algorithm
$l$ is “sweeping” through the domain; we know everything up to the current line $l_i$. Loop invariance moves along with $l$. To the left (arbitrary for the question) of $l$ we know everything. On $l$ we keep track of something that will help us along the way. 

Claim:
	if 2 segments, $s_1$ and $s_2$, $x$-values span $x_1$ and $x_2$, then, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ see $s_1$ and $s_2$ in different orders, then they intersect in that interval. 

Events: discrete set of times (causality is defined according to $l$’s progression) that something happens, or needs to be updated. 
Types of events: 
1. Left endpoint (“birth event”) - predetermined
2. Right endpoint (“death event”) - predetermined
3. Intersection 

Keep track of events in priority queue, segments active in a ordered list of $l$.

From the quiz: 
### Asymptotics
- worst case, expected case (average case), can do best case; but not worth much at all
- time or space

``` ad-note
look into $\Omega$ of lower problems $\rightarrow$ this requires a lot more specific terminology, then can be proved via contradiction (usually): i.e. lowest for *comparison based* sort is $\Omega(\lg n)$. 

When $\Theta \rightarrow O$; stirling approximation of bound $f(x)$? 
```
### Line Segment Intersection


****
## Lecture 02-09-2023
$X$ is some ”space”, such as $\mathbb{R}^2$
path: $\gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow X$ continuously
polygonal path: in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\gamma$ is a polygonal path if it is comprised of only straight line segments, connected at the end-points.
$\gamma$ is *closed* if starts and ends at the same point. 
$\gamma$ is *simple* if edges only intersect if adjacent, and the turning angles not in $\{0\degree, 180\degree\}$ 

($\underline{n} := \{1,2,3,\cdots, n\}\in \mathbb{R}$)

### Jordan-Curve Theorem:
if $\gamma$ is a simple cloned curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $\mathbb{R}^2 \, \backslash \, \gamma$ has 2 path-connected components, the “inside” and the “outside”

Manifold: 
d-manifold is 
- (informally) looks locally like $\mathbb{R}^2$
- (formally) $\forall x \in \mathcal{M}, \exists U \ni x$ s.t. $U \cong \mathbb{R}^d \cong \mathbb{B}_d$ , where $U$ is an open neighborhood, where $\cong$ is homomorphic to aka a continuous bijection, $\mathbb{B}_d$ is open unit ball of dimension d.

2-manifold w/ boundary $X$ is a 2 mfd w/ boundary if each pt locally looks like $\mathbb{B}_2$ or $\mathbb{B}_2\cap \bf{H}$, where $\bf{H}$ is the closed half plane centered at 0 (so this makes $\mathbb{B}_2$ to a semi-circle). This generalizes to $\mathbb{R}^d$. Those that are in the former are the interior points, those in the later are the boundary points. 

$\partial \mathcal{M}:$ boundary of $\mathcal{M}$; $\{x \in \mathcal{M} \text{ s.t. } \exists U \ni x \text{ with } U \cong \mathbb{B}_d \cap \bf{H}\}$


non-manifold examples
K-book (intersection of k planar segments)
graphs (as in a 1-manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$)

### Triangulations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
$\mathcal{M}$ is a manifold w boundary in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
$\partial \mathcal{M}$ is a polygon
A triangulation of $\mathcal{M}$ is a decomposition of $\mathcal{M}$ into a finite number of points, edges, and triangles (to general analogs called simplicies in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d> 2$)
Complex is a shape made out of these simplicies

star shaped shape, $S$: $\exists p \in S$ s.t. $\forall q \in S$, the line segment $\overline{pq} \in S$

$P :=$ Polygon
A triangulation of $P$ is *frugal* if the vertices are exactly the vertices of $P$ 
In the dual graph, a non-frugal triangulation will have cycles. The dual graph, by the converse, gives a tree. <- this is proved via induction

For a frugal triangulation: ears (triangles that are only connected via one edge) correlates to a leaf node in the dual. 

**Lemma**: Every f polygon has a diagonal.
**Proof**: let $v$ be the rightmost vertex of $P$. Let $v_\text{before}$ and $v_\text{after}$ be the vertices before and after $v_j$ in ccw order. 
case 1: the line segment $\overline{v_\text{before} v_\text{after}}$ does not intersect $P$ $\longrightarrow$ we’ve found our ear, and a diagonal. 
case 2: the line segment intersect $P$. Notice $\forall$ parts of $P$ inside the triangle, there is at lest one vertex. let $w$ be the rightmost of these vertices. $\overline{vw}$ is a diagonal (this is a simple proof by contradiction s.t. $w$ is no longer the rightmost vertex).

**Corollary**: Every triangulation of $P$ has an ear.
**Corollary**: Every polygon has a frugal triangulation.

**Def** $x$-monotone polygon: $\forall$ vertical line $l$, $l \cap P$ has one connected component.
Two types of violations: jagged edge the left and to the right. split vertex and merge vertex, as seen from a left to right view. As defined by rhr, both have a negative rotation

**Def** Reflex angle: interior angle that is greater than $180\degree$. 

Is a point $q$ inside of $P$ (take $q \notin \partial P$)? Shoot a ray from $q$ in any direction not intersecting a vertex of $P$. If it intersects $\partial P$ an even number of times, $q \in P$, otherwise $q \notin P$. This works for any embedding of $S^1$. 
Similar idea of winding number on $S^1$ embeddings

————————————
**The problem**: Given a polygon $P$ (simple, closed polygon chain), find a frugal triangulation
**Solution**:
	step 1: find a decomposition into $P$ into monotone polygons by adding diagonals
		we will use a sweep line, where the events are vertices of $P$, sorted by $y$-coord. 
		Sweep line: generically $l \cap \partial P$ (intersections with the edge of $P$) is an even number of points. 
		Keep track of the top intersectsion, let us call them $e_i$’s. The $\text{helper}(e_i)$ is the first vertex encountered inside this area of $P$ (defined under $e_i$) going backwards with the sweep line.
	step 2: solve the sub-problems separately
	step 3: merge together the polygons

****

```ad-note
what is the probability that the 3 points on the same line? Goes to 0. 

if this does happen, we can cause a small perturbation to avoid this. 

We use general position to avoid these issues, and assume that our input is nice.
```

**Lemma:**  
	for a convex hull defined by a set of points s.t. $\{x_i \in CH(P)\}$

1. $x_i \in P$
2. $\overrightarrow{x_1 x_2}$ is a support line - $\forall$ edge $e \in \partial \left(CH\left[P\right]\right)$ all points in $P$ are on the same side of it
3. 3 in a row makes a left turn - positive curvature.

Orientation: $\rm{Orient}(u,v,w)$, use RHR going from $u$ to $v$ gives direction to $w$  
	$\rm{Orient}(u,v,w) = \rm{sign}\left(\rm{det}\begin{pmatrix}1 & u_x & u_y \cr 1 & v_x & v_y \cr 1 & w_x & w_y\end{pmatrix}\right)$: Jack’s Favorite Determinant

**Algorithm**  
	Input: Let $p, q, r$ be 3 random points in $\mathbb{R}^2$  
	Output: counter-clockwise list of vertices define $CH(P)= H$ ($CH:=$ Convex Hull)

## Convex Hulls
“Formally, the convex hull of a point set $P$ is defined to be \[the\] smallest convex set containing $P$. It can be characterized in two provably equivalent ways (one additive and one subtractive). First, it is equal to the set of all convex combinations of points in $P$ and second, it is equal to the intersection of all half spaces that contain $P$” - David Mount’s lecture notes, [[202301241106]]

**Def:** $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $|P|$ is finite. $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a linear combination of points in $P$ if if $\exists$ a coefficient vector $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^d$ s.t. $q = \sum_{i=1}^{|P|}\alpha_i p_i$

``` ad-note
when bounds of the sum $\left(\sum\right)$ are not specified, it can be assumed all elements
```

**Def:** An affine combination of points in $P$ is a linear combination $\sum \alpha_i p_i$ s.t. $\sum \alpha_i = 1$  
“Creating a whole (1) new point by combing the other points. $\alpha_i$ tells us how much of $p_i$ to take.”

**Def:** Convex combination is an affine combination s.t. $\alpha_i \geq 0 \; \forall i$

Barycenter - the center of a shape

**Def:** line in $\mathbb{R}^2$

1. affine combination of two points on the line
2. a point on the line and a vector to indicate direction
3. norm vec and length of geodesic to origin; $h(u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u\cdot x = \sigma\right\}$. $h$ here defines the hyperplane - think of equation of a plane
4. $y=mx+b$

**Def:** direction is a unit vector  
	$\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is the set of directions in $\mathbb{R}^d$

**Def:** halfspaces (defined by hyperplane) - $h^\uparrow (u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u \cdot x > \sigma \right\}$, $\bar{h^\uparrow}(u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u \cdot x \geq \sigma\right\}$; open: does not include the boundary, closed: does include the boundary.

**Def:** Given a convex shape, $H$, and a point $p \in \partial(H)$ we call $l$ a support line if $H$ is entirely on one side of $l$ and $p \in l$.

**Def:** General position (context specific)

* eg no 3+ colinear points
* eq no 4+ co-circular points
