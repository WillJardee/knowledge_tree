# Convex Hulls

“Formally, the convex hull of a point set $P$ is defined to be \[the\] smallest convex set containing $P$. It can be characterized in two provably equivalent ways (one additive and one subtractive). First, it is equal to the set of all convex combinations of points in $P$ and second, it is equal to the intersection of all half spaces that contain $P$” - David Mount’s lecture notes, [[202301241106]]

*These are the same as are in David Mount’s Lecture Notes*  
given a finite set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^2$  
**Def 1:** Smallest convex set that contains $P$; Smallest $\rightarrow$ area  
**Def 2:** The set of all convex combination of points in $P$  
**Def 3:** The intersection of all closed half planes containing $P$.

Convex Hull algorithms:
Input: Set of points, $P \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $|P| < \infty$ 
Output: an ordered list of vertices on the convex hull in counter-clockwise order

```ad-note
what is the probability that the 3 points on the same line? Goes to 0. 

if this does happen, we can cause a small perturbation to avoid this. 

We use general position to avoid these issues, and assume that our input is nice.

**Lemma:**  
	for a convex hull defined by a set of points s.t. $\{x_i \in CH(P)\}$

1. $x_i \in P$
2. $\line{x_1 x_2}$ is a support line - $\forall$ edge $e \in \partial \left(CH\left[P\right]\right)$ all points in $P$ are on the same side of it
3. 3 in a row makes a left turn - positive curvature.

Orientation: $\rm{Orient}(u,v,w)$, use RHR going from $u$ to $v$ gives direction to $w$  
	$\rm{Orient}(u,v,w) = \rm{sign}\left(\rm{det}\begin{pmatrix}1 & u_x & u_y \cr 1 & v_x & v_y \cr 1 & w_x & w_y\end{pmatrix}\right)$: Jack’s Favorite Determinant

**Algorithm**  
	Input: Let $p, q, r$ be 3 random points in $\mathbb{R}^2$  
	Output: counter-clockwise list of vertices define $CH(P)= H$ ($CH:=$ Convex Hull)

**Def:** $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $|P|$ is finite. $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a linear combination of points in $P$ if if $\exists$ a coefficient vector $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^d$ s.t. $q = \sum_{i=1}^{|P|}\alpha_i p_i$

``` ad-note
when bounds of the sum $\left(\sum\right)$ are not specified, it can be assumed all elements
```

**Def:** An affine combination of points in $P$ is a linear combination $\sum \alpha_i p_i$ s.t. $\sum \alpha_i = 1$  
“Creating a whole (1) new point by combing the other points. $\alpha_i$ tells us how much of $p_i$ to take.”

**Def:** Convex combination is an affine combination s.t. $\alpha_i \geq 0 \; \forall i$

Barycenter - the center of a shape

**Def:** line in $\mathbb{R}^2$

1. affine combination of two points on the line
2. a point on the line and a vector to indicate direction
3. norm vec and length of geodesic to origin; $h(u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u\cdot x = \sigma\right\}$. $h$ here defines the hyperplane - think of equation of a plane
4. $y=mx+b$

**Def:** direction is a unit vector  
	$\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is the set of directions in $\mathbb{R}^d$

**Def:** halfspaces (defined by hyperplane) - $h^\uparrow (u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u \cdot x > \sigma \right\}$, $\bar{h^\uparrow}(u, \sigma) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d | u \cdot x \geq \sigma\right\}$; open: does not include the boundary, closed: does include the boundary.

**Def:** Given a convex shape, $H$, and a point $p \in \partial(H)$ we call $l$ a support line if $H$ is entirely on one side of $l$ and $p \in l$.

**Def:** General position (context specific)

* eg no 3+ colinear points
* eq no 4+ co-circular points
