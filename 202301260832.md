Mumey could have taught much clearer - got bogged down with mathematical interpretation.

# Fast Fourier Transform

The goal is to do a Discrete Fourier Transform.  
Use the “roots of unity”, or points that exist on a circle, radius 1, in the imaginary plane.

```ad-note
unit circle already has points that are normalized. That gives a coefficient out front. 
```

label the roots of unity as $\omega^k_n$.  $$w_n^k = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{n}k}$$ Has the properties:
* $\omega_{{\rm d}n}^{{\rm d}k} = \omega_n^k$
* $n$ is a power of 2 assumption: $\omega_n^{n/2} = \omega_2^1 = -1$, $\omega_n^n = 1$
* Halving Lemma: if $n>0$ (even), then the squares of the $n$th roots of unity are the $(n/2)$th roots of unity $$0 \leq k < \frac{n}{2} \longrightarrow \left(\omega_n^k\right)^2 = \omega_n^k \cdot \omega_n^k = \omega_n^{2k} = \omega_{n/2}^k$$$$\left(\omega_n^{k+n/2}\right)^2 = \omega_{n/2}^k$$
* Summation Lemma: assume $n \geq 1$, $\lnot \left(k | n\right)$ $$\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left(\omega_n^k\right)^j = 0$$
