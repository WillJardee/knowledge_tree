# Some Basics

$\mathbb{R}^d = \underbrace{\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}\times \cdots \times \mathbb{R}}_{d}$  
$\rho \in \mathbb{R}^d$ can be a point (the location), or a vector (the direction)  
Scalar: $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^1$

Additive, dot product, scaling all have the regular meaning -> tensor projections of these will be addressed as they come up
