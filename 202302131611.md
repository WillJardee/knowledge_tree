# Technical Debt

## The practitionersâ€™ point of view on the effect of technical debt
**Technical debt** contextual its the problem of pending development tasks as a a type of debt that brings a short-term benefit to teh project, but which may have to be paid with interest later in teh development process. 

- not all technical debt is bad -> debt will be there, we just have to manage it
- gap between perfectly developing a software and making the software work
- not all technical debt is intentional
	- lack of knowledge
- Unintentional debt is more problematic than intentional debt - it depends

short term vs. maintainability

What effects does TD have on software projects?
