# Selection Problem

input: $A$ an unsorted array with distinct values, $\left| A\right| = n$; $k \left(0 \leq k \leq n-1\right)$
Output: $A_\text{sorted}[k]$ 

Use a modified Quicksort algorithm and takes, on average, $O(n)$. So SELECTION PROBLEM $\in \, \Omega(n)$. 

$T(n) = T(n/2) + O(n) = T(n/4) + O(n/2) + O(n) = \cdots \in \Omega (n)$
if it is $n$ deep, then $O(n^2)$, but that is unlucky. So, together SELECTION PROBLEM $\in \Omega(n) \cup O(n^2)$
