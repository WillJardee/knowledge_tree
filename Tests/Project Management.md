>Obsidian is in top form when it helps **manage** and **finish** projects

This vault follows the PARA methodology:

1. When a project is finished, it is moved to [[Archive]]
2. All resources related to a project are kept within the respective parent folder
	1. When a link is found on the internet, it should be trivial to add it to the list of resources in a project
	2. Notes should also be easily made, following the tenets of progressive summarization
