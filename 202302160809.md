# Greedy Algorithms
Algorithms that proceed by making a greedy choice at each step.

Not required to be optimal; if not -> ”greedy heuristic algorithm“

## Activity Selection Problem
input: set of activities, $S = \{a_i\}$, such that each has a start and finishing time, $a_i = (s_i, f_i)$, so $a_i$ “runs” in $[s_i, f_i)$. We say $a_i$ is compatible with $a_j$ iff $[s_i, f_i) \cup [s_j, f_j) = \emptyset$, denoted as $a_i\sim a_j$. 
problem: Compute $A \subseteq S$ s.t. $\forall \, i \neq j \in A$, $a_i \sim a_j$ and $|A|$ is maximized. 

Same as the job schedule in problem, but with $w_i = 1$ for all jobs. This gave $O(n^2)$. Can we make this faster?

Solution: add sequentially according to smallest (valid) $f_i$. 

def: $S_k = \{a_i : f_k \leq s_i\}$

**Lemma**: For any non-empty $S_k$, let $a_m \in S_k$ have the earliest finish time, then $a_m$ isn included in some optimal solution for $S_k$. 
**Proof**: Let OPT be some optimal solution for $S_k$. Suppose $a_m \notin$ OPT. Let $a_e$ be the earliest finishing activity in OPT. The intervals $[f_k, f_m) \subseteq [f_k, f_e)$. Since we know that $[f_k, f_e)$ does not intersect any other intervals in OPT, there is another, OPT solution that includes $a_m$ instead of $a_e$. 

## Knapsack Problem
fractional knapsack - greedy approach by the ratios of $\$_i/w_i$ $\nprec$    
0-1 knapsack - NP hard

## Scheduling to Minimum Latency
Every job has a duration time, $t_i$, and a deadline $d_i$. Latency, $l_i = \max(f_i-d_i, 0)$. $L= \max_i l_i$. 
Schedule all jobs s.t. $L$ is minimized. 

greedy approach: schedule according to increasing deadline
