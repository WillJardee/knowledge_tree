# Affine Objects

“An *affine space* is a set $A$ together with a vector space $\vec{A}$, and a transitive and free action of the additive group of $\vec{A}$ on the set $A$. The elements of teh affine space $A$ are called points. The vector space $\vec{A}$ is said to be associated to the affine space, and its elements are called vectors, translations, or sometimes free vectors.” - [Affine Space, wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space)

$$
\begin{align}
A \times \vec{A} &\rightarrow A\\
(a, v) & \mapsto a+v
\end{align}$$
1. right identify: $$\forall a\in A, \: a+0 = a$$
2. Associativity: $$\forall v, w \in \vec{A}, \, 
$$
