# Gale Shapely Algorithm

****

Initially all m∈M and w∈W are free  
While there is a man m who is free and hasn’t proposed to every woman  
    Choose such a man m  
    Let w be the highest-ranked woman in m’s preference list to whom m has not yet proposed  
    If w is free then  
	    (m, w) become engaged  
    Else w is currently engaged to m‘  
	    If w prefers m‘ to m then  
		    m remains free  
		Else w prefers m to m‘  
			(m, w) become engaged  
			m becomes free  
		Endif  
	Endif  
Endwhile  
Return the set S of engaged pairs

****

runs in $O(n^2)$ time  
	the woman search does not add time b/c you *save* the location in data
