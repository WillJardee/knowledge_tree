> The ==shoots are carefully and gently pruned by hand every two years== leaving only the top boughs, allowing them to grow straight. ==Harvesting takes 20 years== and old 'tree stock' can grow up to a hundred shoots at a time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkm5n9a625vhyfqca6xaak1t))[^1]

To produce lumber without harming the main tree requires a process of gently pruning the tree every two years, and harvesting once every twenty.
