Persistence Diagram Bundles; A Multidimensional Generalization of Vineyards
(by Abigail Hickok UCLA)

Birth and death simplices determine a PD
(under general form assumption, these simplices are unique)
These simplices intersections define collections of ordering of filtration being the same, these make cells which are our bundles.

singularity (multiplicity > 2) (which comes from the multiple variables) of points is what projects us from a vineyard case to this cellular sheaves situation.
